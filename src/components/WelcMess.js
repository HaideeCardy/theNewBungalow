        <h3>Welcome to The New Bungalow</h3>
        <p>As a family we have created lifelong memories across North Norfolk with this home at the heart. It has provided us with a secure and comfortable base to recoup and relax after exploring the coast and the countryside.</p>
        <p>We are excited to now invite others to share in this and create their own memories of such a special place.</p>
        <p>These pages will provide lots of useful information to help our guests make the most of their stay.</p>
        <p>We hope you enjoy it as much as we have.</p>
        <p>Sincerely,<br/>
          The Cardys</p>
